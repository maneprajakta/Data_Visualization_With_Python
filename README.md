# Data_Visualization_With_Python

<h1>Overview</h1>
Visualization of Iris datset using Python library Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn .

The iris data set is most widely used beginner's dataset for machine learning purposes. 

Data set Attribute:
1. sepal length in cm
2. sepal width in cm
3. petal length in cm
4. petal width in cm
5. Species (class):
<br>-- Iris Setosa
<br>-- Iris Versicolour
<br>-- Iris Virginica

The dataset contains 150 samples  also having four features:length and width of sepals and petals and 50 samples of these three species.
 
The dataset is often used in data mining, classification and clustering examples and to test algorithms.

<h1>By Visualizing the dataset what we find</h1>
The dataset contain two clusters with complete sepration:
<br>1.Iris setosa  
<br>2.Iris virginica ,Iris versicolor 

Machile leraning algorithm :
<br>1.Classifiction -supervised learning 
<br>2.K means clustering -unsupervised learning 
ca be used to predict the type of species based on other features.
